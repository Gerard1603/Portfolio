              The network topology is a game to connects the computer network
              and helps players build and manage computer networks using
              different network topologies. Players are presented with a virtual
              environment where they can place nodes (representing computers or
              other network devices) and connect them using variouslinks (wired
              or wireless). The game allows players to experiment with different
              network topologies, such as Star Topology all nodes are connected
              to a central hub or switch. This topology is simple and easy to
              set up but can be a single point of failure. Bus Topology all
              nodes are connected to a single communication line (the bus).
              Nodes can communicate directly with each other, but adding more
              nodes can lead to network congestion. Ring Topology, each node is
              connected to exactly two other nodes, forming a circular ring.
              Data travels in one direction around the ring. This topology is
              resilient but can be slow for large networks. Mesh Topology every
              node is connected to every other node in the network. This
              topology provides high redundancy and fault tolerance but can be
              complex and expensive to implement. Tree Topology nodes are
              arranged hierarchically, with a central root node connecting to
              other nodes in a branching structure.

          <h3>Goofy Bird: A Flappy Bird Clone</h3>
          <div class="project-container">

            <p>
              Goofy Bird is a simple game made with C# that is inspired by the
              popular Flappy Bird game. The game features a bird that the player
              must navigate through a series of obstacles by tapping the screen
              to make the bird flap its wings. The goal is to keep the bird
              flying and avoid hitting the obstacles, which are represented by
              pipes. The game keeps track of the player's score based on how
              many pipes they successfully pass through. The graphics are simple
              and colorful, making it easy for players of all ages to enjoy.
